## GFDNN 
GFDNN (Graph Filter based Deep Neural Network)- Implementation using Tensorflow
## Prerequisites
The following packages are required for executing the main code file:

NumPy http://www.numpy.org/ 

Scikit-learn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

Tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

## Input Data Files
1. Example_targetGeneExpr.csv  
2. Example_PPIEdgelist_adjacency.csv
3. Example_GCN_adjacency.csv

* Expression data matrix (Example_targetGeneExpr.csv): a csv file with m rows and p+1 columns. m is the number of samples and p is the number of features (continuous variables, such as gene expression values). The additional column at last is the 0/1 binary outcome variable vector. This example data set contain gene expression values of 800 genes for 100 samples (m=100 and p=800).
* Gene network/ Feature graph (Example_PPIEdgelist_adjacency.csv): A csv file with p rows and p colunms, which is the corresponding adjacency matrix of the PPI network of genes.
* Gene network/ Feature graph (Example_GCN_adjacency.csv): A csv file with p rows and p colunms, which is the corresponding adjacency matrix of the gene co-expression network of genes.
NOTE: The input file contain no headers.

## RUN GFDNN
Keep all the input files and the file containing the source code in thesame folder and run the python file in terminal using the command:
    python GFDNN.py
Example_Feature_imp_GFDNN.csv is the output file which will be automatically generated by the program. It contains the feature importance values for the considered genes/features.
